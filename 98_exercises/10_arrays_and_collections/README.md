# Collections and Arrays Exercises

###### **Note**: Make sure that you have Text Editor installed

###

#### Ex1

Write a Python program that iterate over elements repeating each as many times as its count.

#### Ex2

Write a Python program to find the most common elements and their counts of a specified text.

#### Ex3

Prompt the user to enter numbers (one by one) and insert those numbers into array, until the the user enters a number that is bigger than 10
    •  Verify that there aren’t any elements that repeat themselves 
    •  Remove the numbers one by one and print them 

#### Ex4
Implement a data structure that will hold a key:value pairs in a variable named:”students”, the key should be an integer and the value should be a list with AT LEAST three INTEGER elements, prompt the user to enter an ID, validate if the ID is in the dictionary and print out the highest grade in the value’s list.

#### Ex5
Build the following array:
[ 2 , “ Hello” , [ “Bye” , [ 6, 3, 1, { “nums” : [10,20,30] } ] ] ] and Replace the [10,20,30] array with their sum (60)


<!--
1. Write a program that receives two strings from the user: one for name and the other for password. If the login information (name and password) matches one of the users of the table below, type "Welcome Master", otherwise "INTRUDER ALERT" should be printed. The proper login details are:

```bash
Name: apple, password: red
Name: lettuce, Password: green
Name: lemon, Password: yellow
Name: orange, Password: orange
```

2. Write a Python program that receives a list of 20 scores through the command line. The program must calculate the average grades and print all grades above the average. For example:
```py
python3 script.py 99 90 15 28 38 44 50 81 79 60 99 90 15 28 38 44 50 81 79 60
```
**printout**:
```bash
99 90 81 79 60 99 90 81 79 60
```
> *_Hint_*: The sys.argv special list represents all the parameters passed to Python through the command line. Try to find it and figure out how to use it to solve the exercise.

3. Given a file named hosts containing rows of hostname = ipaddress form. For example, the contents of such a file might look like this:
```bash
work = 10.0.0.2
router = 10.0.0.1
mycar = 10.0.0.5
home = 194.90.2.1
```
Write a program that receives from the user a list of computers names as command line parameters and prints all the computers IP addresses in the list. If one of the names does not appear in the file, an appropriate error message should be displayed.

4. Write a program that identifies anagrams in a word list: two words are an anagram if they have the same letters in a different order. The program will take a path to a file containing a list of words and print all words that are one anagrams of each other in the same line.

For example, if the file contains the lines:
```bash
add
dad
help
more
Rome
```
**Printout**:
```bash
add dad
help
more rome
```
> (The order of lines in the output is not important, as is the order of words in each line).
