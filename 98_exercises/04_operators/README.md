# Operators Exercises
<!-- assignment and shortcuts or aritmetic-->

## Create a folder named 04_Operators and save all the exercises below in it.

### Aritmetic

#### Ex1 

- Create a Python program/script and name it as exercise number (Ex1.py):
  - create two variables: num1 and num2 and assign them any values:
    - sum them while printing.
    - subtract them while printing.
    - multiply them while printing
    - devide them while printing.
    - exponent them while printing.
    - devide them by floor devision while printing.
    - devide them by modulu while printing.


#### Ex2

- Create a Python program/script and name it as exercise number (Ex2.py):
  - create two variables: num1 and num2 and assign them any values:
    - do all the actions as before, but use short prints.



### Comparisant

#### Ex1 

- Create a Python program/script and name it as exercise number (Ex1.py):
  - create two variables: num1 and num2 and assign them any values:
    - compare them:
      - is 1st bigger ?
      - is 1st lesser ? 
      - is 2nd bigger on equal to 1st ?
      - is 2nd lesser or equal to 1st ?
      - are they not equal ?
      - are they equal ?
    - print the answers to standard out put.

#### Ex2

- Create a Python program/script and name it as exercise number (Ex2.py):
  - create two variables: num1 and num2 and assign them any values:
    - compare them by using short comparisant: (e.g `x += 1`)
      - is 1st bigger ?
      - is 1st lesser ? 
      - is 2nd bigger on equal to 1st ?
      - is 2nd lesser or equal to 1st ?
      - are they not equal ?
      - are they equal ?
    - print the answers to standard out put.

### Logic

#### Ex1 

- Create a Python program/script and name it as exercise number (Ex1.py):
  - create two variables: num_x and num_y and assign them any values:
    - compare them:
      - is 1st bigger ?
      - is 1st lesser ? 
      - is 2nd bigger on equal to 1st ?
      - is 2nd lesser or equal to 1st ?
      - are they not equal ?
      - are they equal ?
    - print the answers to standard out put.


### Identity 

#### Ex1 

- Create a Python program/script and name it as exercise number (Ex1.py):
  - create two variables: var_x and var_y and assign them the same values of collection:(e.g [1,2,3])
    - check if they are equal.
    - check if they have the same identity.
  - print the answers to standard out put.
  - create two variables: dat_x and dat_y and assign them the same values of primitives:(e.g 5 or '2')
    - check if they are equal.
    - check if they have the identity.
  - print the answers to standard out put.


#### Ex2

- Create a Python program/script and name it as exercise number (Ex2.py):
  - create a variable num_x that has a value of 5.
    - check if the type of num_x is not integer.
  - print the answer to standard out put. <!--https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-membership-identity-operators-not-not/-->
