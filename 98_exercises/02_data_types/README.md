###### **Note**: little bit advanced, so don't do it if we have not talked about variables

### Ex10

- Open Terminal/Command line/Powershell:
  - in it open python running environment:
    - create variable `longest_word` and give it a value of: pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis
    - create variable `longest_word_list` and give it next values: (yes: these are real words. so check them in dictionary, what they mean)
      - pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis
      - pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism

    - by using `len()` builtin function check:
      -  what is the length of `longest_word`
      -  what is the length of `longest_word_list`
      -  bonus: what is the length of each individiual word in `longest_word_list`
