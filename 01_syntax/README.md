# Python Syntax
---


Python syntax can be executed by writing directly in the Command Line: ![](./../.img/repl.png)

Or by creating a python file on the server, using the .py file extension, and running it in the Command Line: ![](../.img/vscode.png)


### Python Indentation

Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.
Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.
```py
if 5 > 2:
    print("Five is greater than two!")      #<-- 4 space indentation
```
Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation:

```py
if 5 > 2:
print("Five is greater than two!")  #<-- NO INDENTATION
```


### Python Variables

In Python variables are created the moment you assign a value to it:
```py
x = 5
y = "Hello, World!
```
Python has no command for declaring a variable.
Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for declaring a variable.
A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.


### Comments

Comments can be used to explain Python code.

Comments can be used to make the code more readable.

Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.
Creating a Comment

Comments starts with a #, and Python will ignore them:

```py
#This is a comment
print("Hello, World!")
```
Comments can be placed at the end of a line, and Python will ignore the rest of the line:

```py
print("Hello, World!") #This is a comment
```
Comments does not have to be text to explain the code, it can also be used to prevent Python from executing code:

```py
#print("Hello, World!")
print("Cheers, Mate!")
```
### Multi Line Comments

Python does not really have a syntax for multi line comments.

To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line:

```py
#This is a comment
#written in
#more than just one line
print("Hello, World!")

```

Or, not quite as intended, you can use a multiline string.
Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it:
```py
"""
This is a comment
written in
more than just one line
"""
print("Hello, World!")
```
As long as the string is not assigned to a variable, Python will read the code, but then ignore it, and you have made a multiline comment.
