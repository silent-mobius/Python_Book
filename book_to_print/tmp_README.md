### Programming Language Styles

*   Procedural
*   Object Oriented


### Procedural Languages

Procedural programming is a programming paradigm, derived from structured programming,based on the concept of the procedure call. Procedures, also known as routines, subroutines, or functions, simply contain a series of computational steps to be carried out. Any given procedure might be called at any point during a program's execution, including by other procedures or itself.

*   Procedures/Routines/Subroutines/Functions that include series of functions
*   [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming)



### Object Oriented Languages
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data, in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods). A feature of objects is an object's procedures that can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated (objects have a notion of "this" or "self").

*   Represent objects
*   Define their properties
*   Define ways to manipulate them
*   Object inheritance

### REPL: Python Interpreter 
<!-- needs to have explanation-->
As mentioned [before](#types-of-languages) python is interpreted language. The interpretation for this kind of projects is done in a manner of REPL.

Read–eval–print loop (REPL), also termed an interactive toplevel or language shell, is a simple, interactive computer programming environment that takes single user inputs (i.e., single expressions), evaluates (executes) them, and returns the result to the user.

In a REPL, the user enters one or more expressions (rather than an entire compilation unit) and the REPL evaluates them and displays the results. The name read–eval–print loop comes from the names of the Lisp primitive functions which implement this functionality:

The `read` function accepts an expression from the user, and parses it into a data structure in memory. For instance, the user may enter the s-expression (+ 1 2 3), which is parsed into a linked list containing four data elements.

The `eval` function takes this internal data structure and evaluates it. In Lisp, evaluating an s-expression beginning with the name of a function means calling that function on the arguments that make up the rest of the expression. So the function + is called on the arguments 1 2 3, providing (yielding) the result 6.

The `print` function takes the result provided (yielded) by eval, and prints it out to the user. If it is a complex expression, it may be pretty-printed to make it easier to understand.

The development environment then returns to the read state, creating a `loop`, which terminates when the program is closed. 

REPL's are interactive, by which i mean that they interact with the user by success, the command provided to REPL with work or by error, the command will `NOT` work. REPL usually looks same as command line, for example: 

- Open cmd/terminal of your OS
- Type in it `python3` command and you are in
- It should look like this:
  - ![](../.img/repl.png)
- In case you see  `python 2.7` instead of what you have in picture, then it means that you need to upgrade your current version of python to `python 3.6` or higher.

### Saving the code

Although running in REPL is fun and all, one must always run the list of commands from somewhere, mostly because it misses point of programming if you'll run all the commands manually. 

list of python (or any other high level language) commands that are saved in to the file is usually called as `code`.

To write code, we use a type of `text editor` to write and run it. There are many text editor on www, here is short list of ones that i'd suggest for this course:

- GEANY --> a lightweight IDE for general purpose of development.
  - ![GEANY](../.img/geany.png) 
- ATOM --> a extencible text editor with bunch tools that can be added.
  - ![ATOM](../.img/atom.png) 
- VSCODIUM --> a clone project of atom and vscode with more native OpenSource licensing and agenda.
  - ![VSCODIUM](../.img/vscode.png) 

# Python Syntax
---


Python syntax can be executed by writing directly in the Command Line: [img]

Or by creating a python file on the server, using the .py file extension, and running it in the Command Line: [img]


### Python Indentation

Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.
Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.
```py
if 5 > 2:
    print("Five is greater than two!")      #<-- 4 space indentation
```
Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation:

```py
if 5 > 2:
print("Five is greater than two!")  #<-- NO INDENTATION
```


### Python Variables

In Python variables are created the moment you assign a value to it:
```py
x = 5
y = "Hello, World!
```
Python has no command for declaring a variable.
Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for declaring a variable.
A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.


### Comments

Comments can be used to explain Python code.

Comments can be used to make the code more readable.

Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.
Creating a Comment

Comments starts with a #, and Python will ignore them:

```py
#This is a comment
print("Hello, World!")
```
Comments can be placed at the end of a line, and Python will ignore the rest of the line:

```py
print("Hello, World!") #This is a comment
```
Comments does not have to be text to explain the code, it can also be used to prevent Python from executing code:

```py
#print("Hello, World!")
print("Cheers, Mate!")
```
### Multi Line Comments

Python does not really have a syntax for multi line comments.

To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line:

```py
#This is a comment
#written in
#more than just one line
print("Hello, World!")

```

Or, not quite as intended, you can use a multiline string.
Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it:
```py
"""
This is a comment
written in
more than just one line
"""
print("Hello, World!")
```
As long as the string is not assigned to a variable, Python will read the code, but then ignore it, and you have made a multiline comment.



# Python Data Types

## Built-in Data Types

In programming, data type is an important concept.
Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.
Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:

Type | Value
------------ | -------------
Text | str
Numeric | int, float, complex
Sequence | list, tuple, range
Mapping | dict
Set | set, frozenset
Boolean | bool
Binary | bytes,bytearray

### Getting the Data Type

You can get the data type of any object by using the type() function:

Print the data type of the variable x:

```py
x = 5
print(type(x))
```

### Setting the Data Type

In Python, the data type is set when you assign a value to a variable:

```py
x = "Hello World" #	str 	
x = 20 	#int 	
x = 20.5 	#float 	 	
x = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"] 	#list 	
x = ("apple", "banana", "cherry") 	#tuple 	
x = range(6) 	#range 	
x = {"name" : "John", "age" : 36} 	#dict 	
x = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"} 	#set 	
x = frozenset({"apple", "banana", "cherry"}) 	#frozenset 	
x = True 	#bool 	
x = b"Hello" 	#bytes 	
x = bytearray(5) 	#bytearray 	
x = memoryview(bytes(5)) 	#memoryview 	
```

### Setting the Specific Data Type

If you want to specify the data type, you can use the following constructor functions:

```py
x = str("Hello World") #	str 	
x = int(20) 	#int 	
x = float(20.5) 	#float 	
x = complex(1j) 	#complex 	
x = list(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) 	#list 	
x = tuple(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) 	#tuple 	
x = range(6) 	#range 	
x = dict(name="John", age=36) 	#dict 	
x = set(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) 	#set 	
x = frozenset(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) 	#frozenset 	
x = bool(5) 	#bool 	
x = bytes(5) 	#bytes 	
x = bytearray(5) 	#bytearray 	
x = memoryview(bytes(5)) 	#memoryview 	
```

---

### Python Numbers

There are three numeric types in Python:

* int
* float
<!--*    complex #We are not going to dive in this too deep -->
Variables of numeric types are created when you assign a value to them:

```py
x = 1    # int
y = 2.8  # float
```
<!-- z = 1j   # complex -->

To verify the type of any object in Python, use the type() function:

```py
print(type(x))
print(type(y))
```

<! -- print(type(z)) -->


### Int

Int, or integer, is a whole number, positive or negative, without decimals, of unlimited length.

Integers:

```py
x = 1
y = 35656222554887711
z = -3255522

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))
```

### Float

Float, or "floating point number" is a number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals.

Floats:

```py
x = 1.10
y = 1.0
z = -35.59

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))
```

Float can also be scientific numbers with an "e" to indicate the power of 10.

Floats:

```py
x = 35e3
y = 12E4
z = -87.7e100

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))
```

<!--
Complex

Complex numbers are written with a "j" as the imaginary part:


Complex:
x = 3+5j
y = 5j
z = -5j

print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))
Type Conversion

You can convert from one type to another with the int(), float(), and complex() methods:
-->

Convert from one type to another:

```py
x = 1 # int
y = 2.8 # float
```

<!-- z = 1j # complex -->

> convert from int to float:
  > a = float(x)


> convert from float to int:
  > b = int(y)

<!--
#convert from int to complex:
c = complex(x)
-->

```py
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)

print(type(a))
print(type(b))
print(type(c))
```

> **Note: You cannot convert complex numbers into another number type.**

# Python Strings

## What is String in Python?

A string is a **sequence of characters**.
A character is simply a symbol. For example, the English language has 26 characters.
Computers do not deal with characters, they deal with numbers (binary). 
Even though you may see characters on your screen, internally it is stored and manipulated as a combination of 0's and 1's.
This conversion of character to a number is called encoding, and the reverse process is decoding. 
ASCII and Unicode are some of the popular encoding used.
In Python, string is a sequence of Unicode character. Unicode was introduced to include every character in all languages and bring uniformity in encoding. 
You can learn more about Unicode from [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode).

## How to create a string in Python?

Strings can be created by enclosing characters inside a single quote or double quotes. Even triple quotes can be used in Python but generally used to represent multiline strings and docstrings.

```py
# all of the following are equivalent
my_string = 'Hello'
print(my_string)

my_string = "Hello"
print(my_string)

my_string = '''Hello'''
print(my_string)

# triple quotes string can extend multiple lines
my_string = """Hello, welcome to
           the world of Python"""
print(my_string)
```

When you run the program, the output will be:

```txt
Hello
Hello
Hello
Hello, welcome to
           the world of Python
```

## How to access characters in a string?

We can access individual characters using indexing and a range of characters using slicing. Index starts from 0. Trying to access a character out of index range will raise an IndexError. The index must be an integer. We can't use float or other types, this will result into **TypeError**.
Python allows negative indexing for its sequences.
The index of -1 refers to the last item, -2 to the second last item and so on. We can access a range of items in a string by using the slicing operator (colon).

```py
str = 'programiz'
print('str = ', str)

#first character
print('str[0] = ', str[0])

#last character
print('str[-1] = ', str[-1])

#slicing 2nd to 5th character
print('str[1:5] = ', str[1:5])

#slicing 6th to 2nd last character
print('str[5:-2] = ', str[5:-2])
```

If we try to access index out of the range or use decimal number, we will get errors.

```py
    # index must be in range
    >>> my_string[15]  
    ...
    IndexError: string index out of range
    # index must be an integer
    >>> my_string[1.5] 
    ...
    TypeError: string indices must be integers
```

Slicing can be best visualized by considering the index to be between the elements as shown below.
If we want to access a range, we need the index that will slice the portion from the string.

## How to change or delete a string?

Strings are immutable. This means that elements of a string cannot be changed once it has been assigned. We can simply reassign different strings to the same name.

```py
    >>> del my_string[1]
    ...
    TypeError: 'str' object doesn't support item deletion
    >>> del my_string
    >>> my_string
    ...
    NameError: name 'my_string' is not defined
```

## Python String Operations

There are many operations that can be performed with string which makes it one of the most used datatypes in Python.

### Concatenation of Two or More Strings

Joining of two or more strings into a single one is called concatenation.

The **+** operator does this in Python. Simply writing two string literals together also concatenates them.

The __*__ operator can be used to repeat the string for a given number of times.

```py
str1 = 'Hello'
str2 ='World!'

# using +
print('str1 + str2 = ', str1 + str2)

# using *
print('str1 * 3 =', str1 * 3)
```

Writing two string literals together also concatenates them like + operator.

If we want to concatenate strings in different lines, we can use parentheses.

```py
    >>> # two string literals together
    >>> 'Hello ''World!'
    'Hello World!'
    >>> # using parentheses
    >>> s = ('Hello '
    ...      'World')
    >>> s
    'Hello World'
```

## Iterating Through String

Using for loop we can iterate through a string. Here is an example to count the number of 'l' in a string.

```py
count = 0
for letter in 'Hello World':
    if(letter == 'l'):
        count += 1
print(count,'letters found')
```

## String Membership Test

We can test if a sub string exists within a string or not, using the keyword in.

```py
    >>> 'a' in 'program'
    True
    >>> 'at' not in 'battle'
    False
```

## Built-in functions to Work with Python

Various built-in functions that work with sequence, works with string as well.

Some of the commonly used ones are enumerate() and len(). The enumerate() function returns an enumerate object. It contains the index and value of all the items in the string as pairs. This can be useful for iteration.

Similarly, len() returns the length (number of characters) of the string.

```py
str = 'cold'

# enumerate()
list_enumerate = list(enumerate(str))
print('list(enumerate(str) = ', list_enumerate)

#character count
print('len(str) = ', len(str))
```

## Python String Formatting

###Escape Sequence

If we want to print a text like -He said, "What's there?"- we can neither use single quote or double quotes. This will result into SyntaxError as the text itself contains both single and double quotes.

```py
    >>> print("He said, "What's there?"")
    ...
    SyntaxError: invalid syntax
    >>> print('He said, "What's there?"')
    ...
    SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```
One way to get around this problem is to use triple quotes. Alternatively, we can use escape sequences.

An escape sequence starts with a backslash and is interpreted differently. If we use single quote to represent a string, all the single quotes inside the string must be escaped. Similar is the case with double quotes. Here is how it can be done to represent the above text.

```py
# using triple quotes
print('''He said, "What's there?"''')

# escaping single quotes
print('He said, "What\'s there?"')

# escaping double quotes
print("He said, \"What's there?\"")
```

Here is a list of all the escape sequence supported by Python.

#### Escape Sequence in Python

Escape Sequence | Description
-------------- | -------------------
\newline | Backslash and newline ignored
\\ | Backslash
\' | Single quote
\" | Double quote
\a | ASCII Bell
\b | ASCII Backspace
\f | ASCII Formfeed
\n | ASCII Linefeed
\r | ASCII Carriage Return
\t |ASCII Horizontal Tab
\v | ASCII Vertical Tab
\ooo | Character with octal value ooo
\xHH | Character with hexadecimal value HH

Here are some examples
```py
    >>> print("\\")
    \
    >>> print("This is printed\nin two lines")
    This is printed
    in two lines
    >>> print("This is \x48\x45\x58 representation")
    This is HEX representation
```

### Raw String to ignore escape sequence

Sometimes we may wish to ignore the escape sequences inside a string. To do this we can place r or R in front of the string. This will imply that it is a raw string and any escape sequence inside it will be ignored.

```py
   >>> print("This is \x41 \ngood example")
    This is A
    good example
   >>> print(r"This is \x41 \ngood example")
    This is \x41 \ngood example
```

### The format() Method for Formatting Strings

The format() method that is available with the string object is very versatile and powerful in formatting strings. Format strings contains curly braces {} as placeholders or replacement fields which gets replaced.

We can use positional arguments or keyword arguments to specify the order.

```py
# default(implicit) order
default_order = "{}, {} and {}".format('John','Bill','Sean')
print('\n--- Default Order ---')
print(default_order)

# order using positional argument
positional_order = "{1}, {0} and {2}".format('John','Bill','Sean')
print('\n--- Positional Order ---')
print(positional_order)

# order using keyword argument
keyword_order = "{s}, {b} and {j}".format(j='John',b='Bill',s='Sean')
print('\n--- Keyword Order ---')
print(keyword_order)
```

The format() method can have optional format specifications. They are separated from field name using colon. For example, we can left-justify <, right-justify > or center ^ a string in the given space. We can also format integers as binary, hexadecimal etc. and floats can be rounded or displayed in the exponent format. There are a ton of formatting you can use. Visit here for all the string formatting available with the format() method.

```py
    >>> # formatting integers
    >>> "Binary representation of {0} is {0:b}".format(12)
    'Binary representation of 12 is 1100'
    >>> # formatting floats
    >>> "Exponent representation: {0:e}".format(1566.345)
    'Exponent representation: 1.566345e+03'
    >>> # round off
    >>> "One third is: {0:.3f}".format(1/3)
    'One third is: 0.333'
    >>> # string alignment
    >>> "|{:<10}|{:^10}|{:>10}|".format('butter','bread','ham')
    '|butter    |  bread   |       ham|'
```
### Old style formatting

We can even format strings like the old sprintf() style used in C programming language. We use the % operator to accomplish this.
```py
    >>> x = 12.3456789
    >>> print('The value of x is %3.2f' %x)
    The value of x is 12.35
    >>> print('The value of x is %3.4f' %x)
    The value of x is 12.3457
```

### Common Python String Methods

There are numerous methods available with the string object. The format() method that we mentioned above is one of them. Some of the commonly used methods are lower(), upper(), join(), split(), find(), replace() etc. Here is a complete list of all the built-in methods to work with strings in Python.

```py
    >>> "PrOgRaMiZ".lower()
    'programiz'
    >>> "PrOgRaMiZ".upper()
    'PROGRAMIZ'
    >>> "This will split all words into a list".split()
    ['This', 'will', 'split', 'all', 'words', 'into', 'a', 'list']
    >>> ' '.join(['This', 'will', 'join', 'all', 'words', 'into', 'a', 'string'])
    'This will join all words into a string'
    >>> 'Happy New Year'.find('ew')
    7
    >>> 'Happy New Year'.replace('Happy','Brilliant')
    'Brilliant New Year'
```

# Python List

Python offers a range of compound datatypes often referred to as sequences. List is one of the most frequently used and very versatile datatype used in Python.

## How to create a list?

In Python programming, a list is created by placing all the items (elements) inside a square bracket [ ], separated by commas.
It can have any number of items and they may be of different types (integer, float, string etc.).

```py
    # empty list
    my_list = []
    # list of integers
    my_list = [1, 2, 3]
    # list with mixed datatypes
    my_list = [1, "Hello", 3.4]
```

Also, a list can even have another list as an item. This is called nested list.

```py
# nested list
my_list = ["mouse", [8, 4, 6], ['a']]
```

## How to access elements from a list?

There are various ways in which we can access the elements of a list.

## List Index

We can use the index operator [] to access an item in a list. Index starts from 0. So, a list having 5 elements will have index from 0 to 4.
Trying to access an element other that this will raise an IndexError. The index must be an integer. We can't use float or other types, this will result into TypeError.
Nested list are accessed using nested indexing.

```py
    my_list = ['p','r','o','b','e']
    # Output: p
    print(my_list[0])
    # Output: o
    print(my_list[2])
    # Output: e
    print(my_list[4])
    # Error! Only integer can be used for indexing
    # my_list[4.0]
    # Nested List
    n_list = ["Happy", [2,0,1,5]]
    # Nested indexing
    # Output: a
    print(n_list[0][1])    
    # Output: 5
    print(n_list[1][3])
```

## Negative indexing

Python allows negative indexing for its sequences. The index of -1 refers to the last item, -2 to the second last item and so on.

```py
    my_list = ['p','r','o','b','e']
    # Output: e
    print(my_list[-1])
    # Output: p
    print(my_list[-5])
```

## How to slice lists in Python?

We can access a range of items in a list by using the slicing operator (colon).

```py
    my_list = ['p','y','t','h','o','n',' ','c','o','u','r','s','e']
    # elements 3rd to 5th
    print(my_list[2:5])
    # elements beginning to 4th
    print(my_list[:-5])
    # elements 6th to end
    print(my_list[5:])
    # elements beginning to end
    print(my_list[:])
```

Slicing can be best visualized by considering the index to be between the elements as shown below. So if we want to access a range, we need two indices that will slice that portion from the list.

## How to change or add elements to a list?

List are mutable, meaning, their elements can be changed unlike string or tuple.

We can use assignment operator (=) to change an item or a range of items.

```py

    # mistake values
    odd = [2, 4, 6, 8]
    # change the 1st item
    odd[0] = 1
    # Output: [1, 4, 6, 8]
    print(odd)
    # change 2nd to 4th items
    odd[1:4] = [3, 5, 7]  
    # Output: [1, 3, 5, 7]
    print(odd)
```

We can add one item to a list using append() method or add several items using extend() method.

```py
    odd = [1, 3, 5]
    odd.append(7)
    # Output: [1, 3, 5, 7]
    print(odd)
    odd.extend([9, 11, 13])
    # Output: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13]
    print(odd)
```

We can also use + operator to combine two lists. This is also called concatenation.
The * operator repeats a list for the given number of times.

```py
    odd = [1, 3, 5]
    # Output: [1, 3, 5, 9, 7, 5]
    print(odd + [9, 7, 5])
    #Output: ["re", "re", "re"]
    print(["re"] * 3)
```

Furthermore, we can insert one item at a desired location by using the method insert() or insert multiple items by squeezing it into an empty slice of a list.

```py
    odd = [1, 9]
    odd.insert(1,3)
    # Output: [1, 3, 9] 
    print(odd)
    odd[2:2] = [5, 7]
    # Output: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
    print(odd)
```

## How to delete or remove elements from a list?

We can delete one or more items from a list using the keyword del. It can even delete the list entirely.

```py
    my_list = ['p','r','o','b','l','e','m']
    # delete one item
    del my_list[2]
    # Output: ['p', 'r', 'b', 'l', 'e', 'm']
    print(my_list)
    # delete multiple items
    del my_list[1:5]  
    # Output: ['p', 'm']
    print(my_list)
    # delete entire list
    del my_list
    # Error: List not defined
    print(my_list)
```

We can use remove() method to remove the given item or pop() method to remove an item at the given index.
The pop() method removes and returns the last item if index is not provided. This helps us implement lists as stacks (first in, last out data structure).
We can also use the clear() method to empty a list.

```py
    my_list = ['p','r','o','b','l','e','m']
    my_list.remove('p')
    # Output: ['r', 'o', 'b', 'l', 'e', 'm']
    print(my_list)
    # Output: 'o'
    print(my_list.pop(1))
    # Output: ['r', 'b', 'l', 'e', 'm']
    print(my_list)
    # Output: 'm'
    print(my_list.pop())
    # Output: ['r', 'b', 'l', 'e']
    print(my_list)
    my_list.clear()
    # Output: []
    print(my_list)
```

Finally, we can also delete items in a list by assigning an empty list to a slice of elements.

```py
    >>> my_list = ['p','r','o','b','l','e','m']
    >>> my_list[2:3] = []
    >>> my_list
    ['p', 'r', 'b', 'l', 'e', 'm']
    >>> my_list[2:5] = []
    >>> my_list
    ['p', 'r', 'm']
```

## List Comprehension: Elegant way to create new List

List comprehension is an elegant and concise way to create new list from an existing list in Python.
List comprehension consists of an expression followed by for statement inside square brackets.
Here is an example to make a list with each item being increasing power of 2.

```py
    pow2 = [2 ** x for x in range(10)]
    # Output: [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512]
    print(pow2)
```

This code is equivalent to

```py
    pow2 = []
    for x in range(10):
       pow2.append(2 ** x)
```

A list comprehension can optionally contain more for or if statements. An optional if statement can filter out items for the new list. Here are some examples.

```py
    >>> pow2 = [2 ** x for x in range(10) if x > 5]
    >>> pow2
    [64, 128, 256, 512]
    >>> odd = [x for x in range(20) if x % 2 == 1]
    >>> odd
    [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19]
    >>> [x+y for x in ['Python ','C '] for y in ['Language','Programming']]
    ['Python Language', 'Python Programming', 'C Language', 'C Programming']
```

# Other List Operations in Python

## List Membership Test

We can test if an item exists in a list or not, using the keyword in.

```py
    my_list = ['p','r','o','b','l','e','m']
    # Output: True
    print('p' in my_list)
    # Output: False
    print('a' in my_list)
    # Output: True
    print('c' not in my_list)
```

## Iterating Through a List

Using a for loop we can iterate though each item in a list.

```py
    for fruit in ['apple','banana','mango']:
        print("I like",fruit)
```

# Python Tuple

A tuple in Python is similar to a list. The difference between the two is that we cannot change the elements of a tuple once it is assigned whereas, in a list, elements can be changed.

## Creating a Tuple

A tuple is created by placing all the items (elements) inside parentheses (), separated by commas. The parentheses are optional, however, it is a good practice to use them.

A tuple can have any number of items and they may be of different types (integer, float, list, string, etc.).

```py
    # Empty tuple
    my_tuple = ()
    print(my_tuple)  # Output: ()

    # Tuple having integers
    my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
    print(my_tuple)  # Output: (1, 2, 3) 

    # tuple with mixed datatypes
    my_tuple = (1, "Hello", 3.4)
    print(my_tuple)  # Output: (1, "Hello", 3.4)  

    # nested tuple
    my_tuple = ("mouse", [8, 4, 6], (1, 2, 3))

    # Output: ("mouse", [8, 4, 6], (1, 2, 3)) 
    print(my_tuple)
```

A tuple can also be created without using parentheses. This is known as tuple packing.

```py
    my_tuple = 3, 4.6, "dog"
    print(my_tuple)   # Output: 3, 4.6, "dog" 

    # tuple unpacking is also possible
    a, b, c = my_tuple

    print(a)      # 3
    print(b)      # 4.6 
    print(c)      # dog 
```
Creating a tuple with one element is a bit tricky.

Having one element within parentheses is not enough. We will need a trailing comma to indicate that it is, in fact, a tuple.

```py
    my_tuple = ("hello")
    print(type(my_tuple))  # <class 'str'>

    # Creating a tuple having one element
    my_tuple = ("hello",)  
    print(type(my_tuple))  # <class 'tuple'> 

    # Parentheses is optional
    my_tuple = "hello",
    print(type(my_tuple))  # <class 'tuple'> 
```

## Access Tuple Elements

There are various ways in which we can access the elements of a tuple.
### 1. Indexing

We can use the index operator [] to access an item in a tuple where the index starts from 0.

So, a tuple having 6 elements will have indices from 0 to 5. Trying to access an element outside of tuple (for example, 6, 7,...) will raise an IndexError.

The index must be an integer; so we cannot use float or other types. This will result in TypeError.

Likewise, nested tuples are accessed using nested indexing, as shown in the example below.

```py
    my_tuple = ('p','e','r','m','i','t')

    print(my_tuple[0])   # 'p' 
    print(my_tuple[5])   # 't'

    # IndexError: list index out of range
    # print(my_tuple[6])

    # Index must be an integer
    # TypeError: list indices must be integers, not float
    # my_tuple[2.0]

    # nested tuple
    n_tuple = ("mouse", [8, 4, 6], (1, 2, 3))

    # nested index
    print(n_tuple[0][3])       # 's'
    print(n_tuple[1][1])       # 4
```

### 2. Negative Indexing

Python allows negative indexing for its sequences.

The index of -1 refers to the last item, -2 to the second last item and so on.

```py
    my_tuple = ('p','e','r','m','i','t')

    # Output: 't'
    print(my_tuple[-1])

    # Output: 'p'
    print(my_tuple[-6])
```

### 3. Slicing

We can access a range of items in a tuple by using the slicing operator - colon ":".

```py
    my_tuple = ('p','y','t','h','o','n',' ','c','o','u','r','s','e')

    # elements 2nd to 4th
    # Output: ('r', 'o', 'g')
    print(my_tuple[1:4])

    # elements beginning to 2nd
    # Output: ('p', 'r')
    print(my_tuple[:-7])

    # elements 8th to end
    # Output: ('i', 'z')
    print(my_tuple[7:])

    # elements beginning to end
    # Output: ('p','y','t','h','o','n',' ','c','o','u','r','s','e')
    print(my_tuple[:])
```

Slicing can be best visualized by considering the index to be between the elements as shown below. So if we want to access a range, we need the index that will slice the portion from the tuple.


## Changing a Tuple

Unlike lists, tuples are immutable.

This means that elements of a tuple cannot be changed once it has been assigned. But, if the element is itself a mutable datatype like list, its nested items can be changed.

We can also assign a tuple to different values (reassignment).

```py
my_tuple = (4, 2, 3, [6, 5])


# TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
# my_tuple[1] = 9

# However, item of mutable element can be changed
my_tuple[3][0] = 9    # Output: (4, 2, 3, [9, 5])
print(my_tuple)

# Tuples can be reassigned
my_tuple = ('p','y','t','h','o','n',' ','c','o','u','r','s','e')

# Output: ('p','y','t','h','o','n',' ','c','o','u','r','s','e')
print(my_tuple)
```

We can use + operator to combine two tuples. This is also called concatenation.

We can also repeat the elements in a tuple for a given number of times using the * operator.

Both + and * operations result in a new tuple.

```py
# Concatenation
# Output: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
print((1, 2, 3) + (4, 5, 6))

# Repeat
# Output: ('Repeat', 'Repeat', 'Repeat')
print(("Repeat",) * 3)
```

### Deleting a Tuple

As discussed above, we cannot change the elements in a tuple. That also means we cannot delete or remove items from a tuple.

But deleting a tuple entirely is possible using the keyword del.

```py
my_tuple = ('p','y','t','h','o','n',' ','c','o','u','r','s','e')

# can't delete items
# TypeError: 'tuple' object doesn't support item deletion
# del my_tuple[3]

# Can delete an entire tuple
del my_tuple

# NameError: name 'my_tuple' is not defined
print(my_tuple)
```

## Tuple Methods

Methods that add items or remove items are not available with tuple. Only the following two methods are available.

### Python Tuple Method

Method | Description
------ | -----------
count(x) | Returns the number of items x
index(x) | Returns the index of the first item that is equal to x

Some examples of Python tuple methods:

```py
my_tuple = ('a','p','p','l','e',)

print(my_tuple.count('p'))  # Output: 2
print(my_tuple.index('l'))  # Output: 3
```

## Other Tuple Operations

### 1. Tuple Membership Test

We can test if an item exists in a tuple or not, using the keyword in.

```py
my_tuple = ('a','p','p','l','e',)

# In operation
# Output: True
print('a' in my_tuple)

# Output: False
print('b' in my_tuple)

# Not in operation
# Output: True
print('g' not in my_tuple)
```

### 2. Iterating Through a Tuple

Using a for loop we can iterate through each item in a tuple.

```py
# Output: 
# Hello John
# Hello Kate
for name in ('John','Kate'):
     print("Hello",name)
```

## Advantages of Tuple over List

Since tuples are quite similar to lists, both of them are used in similar situations as well.

However, there are certain advantages of implementing a tuple over a list. Below listed are some of the main advantages:

* We generally use tuple for heterogeneous (different) datatypes and list for homogeneous (similar) datatypes.
* Since tuples are immutable, iterating through tuple is faster than with list. So there is a slight performance boost.
* Tuples that contain immutable elements can be used as a key for a dictionary. With lists, this is not possible.
* If you have data that doesn't change, implementing it as tuple will guarantee that it remains write-protected.

# Python Sets

## What is a set in Python?

A set is an unordered collection of items. Every element is unique (no duplicates) and must be immutable (which cannot be changed). However, the set itself is mutable. We can add or remove items from it. Sets can be used to perform mathematical set operations like union, intersection, symmetric difference etc.

## How to create a set?

A set is created by placing all the items (elements) inside curly braces {}, separated by comma or by using the built-in function set().
It can have any number of items and they may be of different types (integer, float, tuple, string etc.). But a set cannot have a mutable element, like list, set or dictionary, as its element.

```py
# set of integers
my_set = {1, 2, 3}
print(my_set)

# set of mixed datatypes
my_set = {1.0, "Hello", (1, 2, 3)}
print(my_set)
```

Try the following examples as well.

```py
# set do not have duplicates
# Output: {1, 2, 3, 4}
my_set = {1,2,3,4,3,2}
print(my_set)

# set cannot have mutable items
# here [3, 4] is a mutable list
# If you uncomment line #12,
# this will cause an error.
# TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'

#my_set = {1, 2, [3, 4]}

# we can make set from a list
# Output: {1, 2, 3}
my_set = set([1,2,3,2])
print(my_set)
```

Creating an empty set is a bit tricky.

Empty curly braces {} will make an empty dictionary in Python. To make a set without any elements we use the set() function without any argument.

```py
# initialize a with {}
a = {}

# check data type of a
# Output: <class 'dict'>
print(type(a))

# initialize a with set()
a = set()

# check data type of a
# Output: <class 'set'>
print(type(a))
```

## How to change a set in Python?

Sets are mutable. But since they are unordered, indexing have no meaning.
We cannot access or change an element of set using indexing or slicing. Set does not support it.
We can add single element using the add() method and multiple elements using the update() method. The update() method can take tuples, lists, strings or other sets as its argument. In all cases, duplicates are avoided.

```py
# initialize my_set
my_set = {1,3}
print(my_set)

# if you uncomment line 9,
# you will get an error
# TypeError: 'set' object does not support indexing

#my_set[0]

# add an element
# Output: {1, 2, 3}
my_set.add(2)
print(my_set)

# add multiple elements
# Output: {1, 2, 3, 4}
my_set.update([2,3,4])
print(my_set)

# add list and set
# Output: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8}
my_set.update([4,5], {1,6,8})
print(my_set)
```

## How to remove elements from a set?

A particular item can be removed from set using methods, discard() and remove().

The only difference between the two is that, while using discard() if the item does not exist in the set, it remains unchanged. But remove() will raise an error in such condition.

The following example will illustrate this.

```py
# initialize my_set
my_set = {1, 3, 4, 5, 6}
print(my_set)

# discard an element
# Output: {1, 3, 5, 6}
my_set.discard(4)
print(my_set)

# remove an element
# Output: {1, 3, 5}
my_set.remove(6)
print(my_set)

# discard an element
# not present in my_set
# Output: {1, 3, 5}
my_set.discard(2)
print(my_set)

# remove an element
# not present in my_set
# If you uncomment line 27,
# you will get an error.
# Output: KeyError: 2

#my_set.remove(2)
```

Similarly, we can remove and return an item using the pop() method.

Set being unordered, there is no way of determining which item will be popped. It is completely arbitrary.

We can also remove all items from a set using clear().

```py
# initialize my_set
# Output: set of unique elements
my_set = set("HelloWorld")
print(my_set)

# pop an element
# Output: random element
print(my_set.pop())

# pop another element
# Output: random element
my_set.pop()
print(my_set)

# clear my_set
#Output: set()
my_set.clear()
print(my_set)
```

## Python Set Operations

Sets can be used to carry out mathematical set operations like union, intersection, difference and symmetric difference. We can do this with operators or methods.

Let us consider the following two sets for the following operations.

```py
    >>> A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
    >>> B = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
```

## Different Python Set Methods

There are many set methods, some of which we have already used above. Here is a list of all the methods that are available with set objects.
Python Set Methods 
Method |	Description
------ |    -----------
add() |	Adds an element to the set
clear() |	Removes all elements from the set
copy() |	Returns a copy of the set
difference() |	Returns the difference of two or more sets as a new set
difference_update() |	Removes all elements of another set from this set
discard() |	Removes an element from the set if it is a member. (Do nothing if the element is not in set)
intersection() |	Returns the intersection of two sets as a new set
intersection_update() |	Updates the set with the intersection of itself and another
isdisjoint() |	Returns True if two sets have a null intersection
issubset() |	Returns True if another set contains this set
issuperset() |	Returns True if this set contains another set
pop() |	Removes and returns an arbitary set element. Raise KeyError if the set is empty
remove() |	Removes an element from the set. If the element is not a member, raise a KeyError
symmetric_difference() |	Returns the symmetric difference of two sets as a new set
symmetric_difference_update() |	Updates a set with the symmetric difference of itself and another
union() |	Returns the union of sets in a new set
update() |	Updates the set with the union of itself and others

## Other Set Operations

### Set Membership Test

We can test if an item exists in a set or not, using the keyword in.

```py
# initialize my_set
my_set = set("apple")

# check if 'a' is present
# Output: True
print('a' in my_set)

# check if 'p' is present
# Output: False
print('p' not in my_set)
```

## Iterating Through a Set

Using a for loop, we can iterate though each item in a set.

```py
    >>> for letter in set("apple"):
    ...     print(letter)
    ...    
    a
    p
    e
    l
```

## Built-in Functions with Set

Built-in functions like all(), any(), enumerate(), len(), max(), min(), sorted(), sum() etc. are commonly used with set to perform different tasks.
Built-in Functions with Set
Function |	Description
-------- |  ------------
all() |	Return True if all elements of the set are true (or if the set is empty).
any() |	Return True if any element of the set is true. If the set is empty, return False.
enumerate() |	Return an enumerate object. It contains the index and value of all the items of set as a pair.
len() |	Return the length (the number of items) in the set.
max() |	Return the largest item in the set.
min() |	Return the smallest item in the set.
sorted() |	Return a new sorted list from elements in the set(does not sort the set itself).
sum() |	Retrun the sum of all elements in the set.

# Python Frozenset

Frozenset is a new class that has the characteristics of a set, but its elements cannot be changed once assigned. While tuples are immutable lists, frozensets are immutable sets.
Sets being mutable are unhashable, so they can't be used as dictionary keys. On the other hand, frozensets are hashable and can be used as keys to a dictionary.

Frozensets can be created using the function frozenset().

This datatype supports methods like copy(), difference(), intersection(), isdisjoint(), issubset(), issuperset(), symmetric_difference() and union(). Being immutable it does not have method that add or remove elements.

```py
A = frozenset([1, 2, 3, 4])
B = frozenset([3, 4, 5, 6])
```

Try these examples on Python shell.

```py
    >>> A.isdisjoint(B)
    False
    >>> A.difference(B)
    frozenset({1, 2})
    >>> A | B
    frozenset({1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6})
    >>> A.add(3)
    ...
    AttributeError: 'frozenset' object has no attribute 'add'
```

# Python Dictionary

Python dictionary is an unordered collection of items. While other compound data types have only value as an element, a dictionary has a **key: value** pair.

Dictionaries are optimized to retrieve values when the key is known.
## How to create a dictionary?

Creating a dictionary is as simple as placing items inside curly braces {} separated by comma.
An item has a key and the corresponding value expressed as a pair, **key: value**.
While values can be of any data type and can repeat, keys must be of immutable type (string, number or tuple with immutable elements) and must be unique.

```py
# empty dictionary
my_dict = {}
# dictionary with integer keys
my_dict = {1: 'apple', 2: 'ball'}
# dictionary with mixed keys
my_dict = {'name': 'John', 1: [2, 4, 3]}
# using dict()
my_dict = dict({1:'apple', 2:'ball'})
# from sequence having each item as a pair
my_dict = dict([(1,'apple'), (2,'ball')])
```

As you can see above, we can also create a dictionary using the built-in function dict().

## How to access elements from a dictionary?

While indexing is used with other container types to access values, dictionary uses keys. Key can be used either inside square brackets or with the get() method.
The difference while using get() is that it returns None instead of KeyError, if the key is not found.
```py
my_dict = {'name':'Jack', 'age': 26}

# Output: Jack
print(my_dict['name'])

# Output: 26
print(my_dict.get('age'))

# Trying to access keys which doesn't exist throws error
# my_dict.get('address')
# my_dict['address']
```

## How to change or add elements in a dictionary?

Dictionary are mutable. We can add new items or change the value of existing items using assignment operator.
If the key is already present, value gets updated, else a new key: value pair is added to the dictionary.

```py
my_dict = {'name':'Jack', 'age': 26}

# update value
my_dict['age'] = 27

#Output: {'age': 27, 'name': 'Jack'}
print(my_dict)

# add item
my_dict['address'] = 'Downtown'  

# Output: {'address': 'Downtown', 'age': 27, 'name': 'Jack'}
print(my_dict)
```

## How to delete or remove elements from a dictionary?

We can remove a particular item in a dictionary by using the method pop(). This method removes as item with the provided key and returns the value.
The method, popitem() can be used to remove and return an arbitrary item (key, value) form the dictionary. All the items can be removed at once using the clear() method.
We can also use the del keyword to remove individual items or the entire dictionary itself.

```py
# create a dictionary
squares = {1:1, 2:4, 3:9, 4:16, 5:25}  

# remove a particular item
# Output: 16
print(squares.pop(4))  

# Output: {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 5: 25}
print(squares)

# remove an arbitrary item
# Output: (1, 1)
print(squares.popitem())

# Output: {2: 4, 3: 9, 5: 25}
print(squares)

# delete a particular item
del squares[5]  

# Output: {2: 4, 3: 9}
print(squares)

# remove all items
squares.clear()

# Output: {}
print(squares)

# delete the dictionary itself
del squares

# Throws Error
# print(squares)
```

## Python Dictionary Methods

Methods that are available with dictionary are tabulated below. Some of them have already been used in the above examples.
Python Dictionary Methods 
Method |	Description
------ |    ----------
clear() |	Remove all items form the dictionary.
copy() |	Return a shallow copy of the dictionary.
fromkeys(seq[, v]) |	Return a new dictionary with keys from seq and value equal to v (defaults to None).
get(key[,d]) |	Return the value of key. If key doesnot exit, return d (defaults to None).
items() |	Return a new view of the dictionary's items (key, value).
keys() |	Return a new view of the dictionary's keys.
pop(key[,d]) |	Remove the item with key and return its value or d if key is not found. If d is not provided and key is not found, raises KeyError.
popitem() |	Remove and return an arbitary item (key, value). Raises KeyError if the dictionary is empty.
setdefault(key[,d]) |	If key is in the dictionary, return its value. If not, insert key with a value of d and return d (defaults to None).
update([other]) |	Update the dictionary with the key/value pairs from other, overwriting existing keys.
values() |	Return a new view of the dictionary's values

Here are a few example use of these methods.

```py
marks = {}.fromkeys(['Math','English','Science'], 0)

# Output: {'English': 0, 'Math': 0, 'Science': 0}
print(marks)

for item in marks.items():
    print(item)

# Output: ['English', 'Math', 'Science']
list(sorted(marks.keys()))
```

## Python Dictionary Comprehension

Dictionary comprehension is an elegant and concise way to create new dictionary from an iterable in Python.
Dictionary comprehension consists of an expression pair (key: value) followed by for statement inside curly braces {}.
Here is an example to make a dictionary with each item being a pair of a number and its square.

```py
squares = {x: x*x for x in range(6)}

# Output: {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25}
print(squares)
```

A dictionary comprehension can optionally contain more for or if statements.
An optional if statement can filter out items to form the new dictionary.
Here are some examples to make dictionary with only odd items.


# Other Dictionary Operations

## Dictionary Membership Test

We can test if a key is in a dictionary or not using the keyword in. Notice that membership test is for keys only, not for values.

```py
squares = {1: 1, 3: 9, 5: 25, 7: 49, 9: 81}

# Output: True
print(1 in squares)

# Output: True
print(2 not in squares)

# membership tests for key only not value
# Output: False
print(49 in squares)
```

## Iterating Through a Dictionary

Using a for loop we can iterate though each key in a dictionary.
```py
squares = {1: 1, 3: 9, 5: 25, 7: 49, 9: 81}
for i in squares:
    print(squares[i])
```

## Built-in Functions with Dictionary

Built-in functions like all(), any(), len(), cmp(), sorted() etc. are commonly used with dictionary to perform different tasks.
Built-in Functions with Dictionary

Function |	Description
------- |   ----------
all() |	Return True if all keys of the dictionary are true (or if the dictionary is empty).
any() |	Return True if any key of the dictionary is true. If the dictionary is empty, return False.
len() |	Return the length (the number of items) in the dictionary.
cmp() |	Compares items of two dictionaries.
sorted() |	Return a new sorted list of keys in the dictionary.

Here are some examples that uses built-in functions to work with dictionary.

```py
squares = {1: 1, 3: 9, 5: 25, 7: 49, 9: 81}

# Output: 5
print(len(squares))

# Output: [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
print(sorted(squares))
```

# Python Operators

## What are operators in python?

Operators are special symbols in Python that carry out arithmetic or logical computation. The value that the operator operates on is called the operand.

For example:
```py
>>> 2+3
5
```

Here, + is the operator that performs addition. 2 and 3 are the operands and 5 is the output of the operation.

### Arithmetic operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication etc.

Operator | Meaning | Example
--------| -------- | ---------
+ | Add two operands or unary plus 	| x + y  +2
- |	Subtract right operand from the left or unary minus | x - y -2
* |	Multiply two operands |	x * y
/ |	Divide left operand by the right one (always results into float) | x / y
% |	Modulus - remainder of the division of left operand by the right | x % y (remainder of x/y)
// | Floor division - division that results into whole number adjusted to the left in the number line | x // y
** | Exponent - left operand raised to the power of right | x**y (x to the power y)

#### Example : Arithmetic operators in Python
``` py
x = 15
y = 4
# Output: x + y = 19
print('x + y =',x+y)
# Output: x - y = 11
print('x - y =',x-y)
# Output: x * y = 60
print('x * y =',x*y)
# Output: x / y = 3.75
print('x / y =',x/y)
# Output: x // y = 3
print('x // y =',x//y)
# Output: x ** y = 50625
print('x ** y =',x**y)
```

When you run the program, the output will be:
```py 
x + y = 19
x - y = 11
x * y = 60
x / y = 3.75
x // y = 3
x ** y = 50625
```
### Comparison operators

Comparison operators are used to compare values. It either returns True or False according to the condition.


Operator | Meaning | Example
-------- | ------- | ------- 
> |	Greater that - True if left operand is greater than the right | x > y
< |	Less that - True if left operand is less than the right | x < y
== |	Equal to - True if both operands are equal 	| x == y
!= |	Not equal to - True if operands are not equal |	x != y
>= |	Greater than or equal to - True if left operand is greater than or equal to the right |	x >= y
<= |	Less than or equal to - True if left operand is less than or equal to the right | x <= y

Example : Comparison operators in Python

```py
x = 10
y = 12
# Output: x > y is False
print('x > y  is',x>y)
# Output: x < y is True
print('x < y  is',x<y)
# Output: x == y is False
print('x == y is',x==y)
# Output: x != y is True
print('x != y is',x!=y)
# Output: x >= y is False
print('x >= y is',x>=y)
# Output: x <= y is True
print('x <= y is',x<=y)
```

Logical operators

Logical operators are the and, or, not operators.

Operator | Meaning | Example
------- | -------- | ----------
and |	True if both the operands are true |	x and y
or 	|   True if either of the operands is true 	| x or y
not | 	True if operand is false (complements the operand) | not x

Example : Logical Operators in Python
```py
x = True
y = False
# Output: x and y is False
print('x and y is',x and y)
# Output: x or y is True
print('x or y is',x or y)
# Output: not x is False
print('not x is',not x)
```


The truth table for and is given below:
#### Truth table for *_and_*

A |	B |	A and B
-- \| -- | --- 
True |	True |	True
True |	False |	False
False |	True |	False
False |	False |	False

####  The truth table for *_or_* is given below:

Truth table for or
A |	B |	A or B
-- | -- | ---
True | True | True
True | False | True
False | True | True
False | False | False

#### The truth table for *_not_* is given below:

Truth tabel for not 
A |	not A
-- | --
True |	False
False |	True

some example of their usage are given below
```py
>>> True and False
False
>>> True or False
True
>>> not False
True
```

### Bitwise operators

Bitwise operators act on operands as if they were string of binary digits. It operates bit by bit, hence the name.

For example, 2 is 10 in binary and 7 is 111.

In the table below: Let x = 10 (0000 1010 in binary) and y = 4 (0000 0100 in binary)

Bitwise operators in Python 
Operator | Meaning |	Example
------- | ------ | --------
& |	Bitwise AND |	x& y = 0 (0000 0000)
\||	Bitwise OR 	| x \| y = 14 (0000 1110)
~ |	Bitwise NOT |	~x = -11 (1111 0101)
^ |	Bitwise XOR |	x ^ y = 14 (0000 1110)
>> |	Bitwise right shift |	x>> 2 = 2 (0000 0010)
<< |	Bitwise left shift |	x<< 2 = 40 (0010 1000)




<!-- TODO : add descripttion and examples for the bitwise operators-->





### Assignment operators

Assignment operators are used in Python to assign values to variables.

a = 5 is a simple assignment operator that assigns the value 5 on the right to the variable a on the left.

There are various compound operators in Python like a += 5 that adds to the variable and later assigns the same. It is equivalent to a = a + 5.

Assignment operators in Python 

Operator |	Example |	Equivatent to
-------  | ------- | ---------------
= |	x = 5 |	x = 5
+= |	x += 5 |	x = x + 5
-= |	x -= 5 |	x = x - 5
*= |	x *= 5 |	x = x * 5
/= |	x /= 5 |	x = x / 5
%= |	x %= 5 |	x = x % 5
//= |	x //= 5 |	x = x // 5
**= |	x **= 5 | 	x = x ** 5
&= |	x &= 5 |	x = x & 5
|= |	x |= 5 |	x = x | 5
^= |	x ^= 5 |	x = x ^ 5
>>= |	x >>= 5 |	x = x >> 5
<<= |	x <<= 5 |	x = x << 5

### Special operators

Python language offers some special type of operators like the identity operator or the membership operator. They are described below with examples.
Identity operators

is and is not are the identity operators in Python. They are used to check if two values (or variables) are located on the same part of the memory. Two variables that are equal does not imply that they are identical.

Identity operators in Python 
Operator |	Meaning |	Example
------- | ------- | ---------
is |	True if the operands are identical (refer to the same object)  |	x is True
is not 	| True if the operands are not identical (do not refer to the same object) |	x is not True

Example : Identity operators in Python
``` py
x1 = 5
y1 = 5
x2 = 'Hello'
y2 = 'Hello'
x3 = [1,2,3]
y3 = [1,2,3]
# Output: False
print(x1 is not y1)
# Output: True
print(x2 is y2)
# Output: False
print(x3 is y3)
```

Here, we see that x1 and y1 are integers of same values, so they are equal as well as identical. Same is the case with x2 and y2 (strings).

But x3 and y3 are list. They are equal but not identical. It is because interpreter locates them separately in memory although they are equal.
Membership operators

in and not in are the membership operators in Python. They are used to test whether a value or variable is found in a sequence (string, list, tuple, set and dictionary).

In a dictionary we can only test for presence of key, not the value.
Operator | 	Meaning |	Example
------- | --------- | ----------
in |	True if value/variable is found in the sequence |	5 in x
not in |	True if value/variable is not found in the sequence |	5 not in x

Example : Membership operators in Python
```py
x = 'Hello world'
y = {1:'a',2:'b'}
# Output: True
print('H' in x)
# Output: True
print('hello' not in x)
# Output: True
print(1 in y)
# Output: False
print('a' in y)
```
Here, 'H' is in x but 'hello' is not present in x (remember, Python is case sensitive). Similary, 1 is key and 'a' is the value in dictionary y. Hence, 'a' in y returns False.

# Python Printout

The printout in python can e done with a print() function, with keyword arguments to replace most of the special syntax of the old print statement.

The print statement can be used in the following ways :

```python
    print("Good Morning")
    print("Good", <Variable Containing the String>)
    print("Good" + <Variable Containing the String>)
    print("Good %s" % <variable containing the string>)
```

In Python, __single, double and triple__ quotes are used to denote a string. Most use single quotes when declaring a single character. Double quotes when declaring a line and triple quotes when declaring a paragraph/multiple lines.

### Double Quotes Use

```python
print("Python is very simple language")
```

> Output:
> Python is very simple language

### Single Quotes Use

```python
print('Hello')
```

> Output:
> Hello

### Triple Quotes Use

```python
print("""Python is very popular language.
It is also friendly language.""")
```

>Output:
Python is very Popular Language.
It is also friendly language.

### Variable Use

Strings can be assigned to variable say string1 and string2 which can called when using the print statement.

```python
str1 = 'Wel'
print(str1,'come')
```

> Output:Wel come

```python
str1 = 'Welcome'
str2 = 'Python'
print(str1, str2)
```

> Output: Welcome Python

### String Concatenation

String concatenation is the "addition" of two strings. Observe that while concatenating there will be no space between the strings.

```python
str1 = 'Python'
str2 = ':'
print('Welcome' + str1 + str2)
```

> Output: WelcomePython:

### Using as String

%s is used to refer to a variable which contains a string.

```python
str1 = 'Python'
print("Welcome %s" % str1)
```

> Output: Welcome Python

### Using other data types

Similarly, when using other data types

%d | Integer
%e | exponential
%f | Float
%o | Octal
%x | Hexadecimal

This can be used for conversions inside the print statement itself.

#### Using as Integer

```python
print("Actual Number = %d" %15)
```

> Output: Actual Number = 15

#### Using as Exponential

```python
print("Exponential equivalent of the number = %e" %15)
```

> Output: Exponential equivalent of the number = 1.500000e+01

#### Using as Float

```python
print("Float of the number = %f" %15)
```

> Output: Float of the number = 15.000000

#### Using as Octal

```python
print("Octal equivalent of the number = %o" %15)
```

> Output: Octal equivalent of the number = 17

#### Using as Hexadecimal

```python
print("Hexadecimal equivalent of the number = %x" %15)
```

> Output: Hexadecimal equivalent of the number = f

#### Using multiple variables

When referring to multiple variables parenthesis is used.

```python
str1 = 'World'
str2 = ':'
print("Python %s %s" %(str1,str2))
```

> Output: Python World :

Other Examples of Print Statement:

The following are other different ways the print statement can be put to use.

#### Example-1:

```python
% is used for %d type word

print("Welcome to %%Python %s" %'language')
```

> Output: Welcome to %Python language

#### Example-2:

```python
\n is used for Line Break.

print("Sunday\nMonday\nTuesday\nWednesday\nThursday\nFriday\nSaturday")
```

Output:
> Sunday
> Monday
> Tuesday
> Wednesday
> Thursday
> Friday
> Saturday

#### Example-3:

Any word print multiple times.

```python
print('-w3r'*5)
```

> Output: -w3r-w3r-w3r-w3r-w3r

#### Example-4:

```python
\t is used for tab.

print("""
Language:
\t1 Python
\t2 Java\n\t3 JavaScript
""")
```

> Output: 
 > Language:
 >  1 Python
 >  2 Java
 >  3 JavaScript

### Precision Width and Field Width

Field width is the width of the entire number and precision is the width towards the right. One can alter these widths based on the requirements.

The default Precision Width is set to 6.

#### Example-1

Notice upto 6 decimal points are returned. To specify the number of decimal points, '%(fieldwidth).(precisionwidth)f' is used.

```python
print("%f" % 5.1234567890)
```

> Output: 5.123457

#### Example-2

Notice upto 5 decimal points are returned

```python
print("%.5f" % 5.1234567890)
```

> Output: 5.12346

#### Example-3

If the field width is set more than the necessary than the data right aligns itself to adjust to the specified values.

```python
print("%9.5f" % 5.1234567890)
```

> Output:  5.12346

#### Example-4

Zero padding is done by adding a 0 at the start of fieldwidth.

```python
print("%015.5f" % 5.1234567890)
```

> Output: 000000005.12346

#### Example-5

For proper alignment, a space can be left blank in the field width so that when a negative number is used, proper alignment is maintained.

```python
print("% 9f" % 5.1234567890)
print("% 9f" % -5.1234567890)
```

> Output:
> 5.123457
> -5.123457

#### Example-6

'+' sign can be returned at the beginning of a positive number by adding a + sign at the beginning of the field width.

```python
print("%+9f" % 5.1234567890)
print("% 9f" % -5.1234567890)
```

>Output:
> +5.123457
> -5.123457

#### Example-7

As mentioned above, the data right aligns itself when the field width mentioned is larger than the actually field width. But left alignment can be done by specifying a negative symbol in the field width.

```python
print("%-9.4f" % 5.1234567890)
```

> Output: 5.1235

# Python Command Line Input

Python allows for command line input.
That means we are able to ask the user for input.
The method is a bit different in Python 3.6 than Python 2.7.

* Python 3.6 uses the input() method.
* Python 2.7 uses the raw_input() method.

The following example asks for the user's name, and when you entered the name, the name gets printed to the screen:

> Python 3.6
```python
print("Enter your name:")
x = input()
print("Hello ", x)
```

```python
Python 2.7
print("Enter your name:")
x = raw_input()
print("Hello ", x)
```

> Save this file as demo_input.py, and load it through the command line/poweshell:
C:\Users\Your Name>python demo_input.py

Our program will prompt the user for a string:
Enter your name:

The user now enters a name:
Alex

Then, the program prints it to screen with a little message:
> Hello Alex


# Python Operators, Conditions and If statements

## Python Arithmetic, Comparison and Logical Operators

### Arithmetic Operators

Operator | Name | Example | Result
------ | ------ | -------- | ------
+ | Addition | x+y | Sum of x and y.
- | Subtraction | x-y | Difference of x and y.
* | Multiplication | x*y | Product of x and y.
/ | Division | x/y | Quotient of x and y.
% | Modulus | x%y | Remainder of x divided by y.
** | Exponent | x**y | x**y will give x to the power y
// | Floor Division | x/ y | The division of operands where the result is the quotient in which the digits after the decimal point are removed.

These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.

### Comparison Operators

Operator | Name | Example | Result
------ | ------ | -------- | ------
== | Equal | x==y | True if x is exactly equal to y.
!= | Not equal | x!=y | True if x is exactly not equal to y.
> | Greater than | x>y | True if x (left-hand argument) is greater than y (right-hand argument).
< | Less than | x<y | True if x (left-hand argument) is less than y (right-hand argument).
>= | Greater than or equal to | x>=y | True if x (left-hand argument) is greater than or equal to y (left-hand argument).
<= | Less than or equal to | x<=y | True if x (left-hand argument) is less than or equal to y (right-hand argument).

### Logical Operators

Operator | Example | Result
------ | ------ | ------
and | (x and y) | is True if both x and y are true.
or | (x or y) | is True if either x or y is true.
not | (x not y) | If a condition is true then Logical not operator will make false.

### Assignment Operators

Operator | Shorthand | Expression | Description
------ | ------ | -------- | ------
+= | x+=y | x = x + y | Adds 2 numbers and assigns the result to left operand.
-= | x-= y | x = x -y | Subtracts 2 numbers and assigns the result to left operand.
*= |x*= y | x = x*y | Multiplies 2 numbers and assigns the result to left operand.
/= | x/= y | x = x/y | Divides 2 numbers and assigns the result to left operand.
%= | x%= y | x = x%y | Computes the modulus of 2 numbers and assigns the result to left operand.
**= | x**=y | x = x**y | Performs exponential (power) calculation on operators and assign value to the equivalent to left operand.
//= | x//=y | x = x//y | Performs floor division on operators and assign value to the left operand.

## Conditional Operators

Conditional expressions or ternary operator have the lowest priority of all Python operations. The expression x if C else y first evaluates the condition, C (not x); if C is true, x is evaluated and its value is returned; otherwise, y is evaluated and its value is returned.

## if..elif..else

The if-elif-else statement is used to conditionally execute a statement or a block of statements. Conditions can be true or false, execute one thing when the condition is true, something else when the condition is false

if statement

The Python if statement is same as it is with other programming languages. It executes a set of statements conditionally, based on the value of a logical expression.

Syntax:
```python
if expression :
    statement_1 
    statement_2
    ....

```

In the above case, expression specifies the conditions which are based on Boolean expression. When a Boolean expression is evaluated it produces either a value of true or false. If the expression evaluates true the same amount of indented statement(s) following if will be executed. This group of the statement(s) is called a block

### if .. else statement

In Python if .. else statement, if has two blocks, one following the expression and other following the else clause. Here is the syntax.

Syntax:

```python
    if expression :
        statement_1
        statement_2
        ....
    else : 
        statement_3 
        statement_4
        ....
```

In the above case if the expression evaluates to true the same amount of indented statements(s) following if will be executed and if the expression evaluates to false the same amount of indented statements(s) following else will be executed. See the following example. The program will print the second print statement as the value of a is 10.

```python
a=10
if(a>10):
    print("Value of a is greater than 10")
else :
    print("Value of a is 10")
```

### if .. elif .. else statement

Sometimes a situation arises when there are several conditions. To handle the situation Python allows adding any number of elif clause after an if and before an else clause. Here is the syntax.

Syntax:

```python
if expression1 :
         statement_1
         statement_2
         ....
   elif expression2 :
     statement_3
     statement_4
     ....
   elif expression3 :
     statement_5
     statement_6
     ....................
   else :
     statement_7
     statement_8
```

In the above case Python evaluates each expression (i.e. the condition) one by one and if a true condition is found the statement(s) block under that expression will be executed. If no true condition is found the statement(s) block under else will be executed. In the following example, we have applied if, series of elif and else to get the type of a variable.

```python
var1 = 1+2j
if (type(var1) == int):
    print("Type of the variable is Integer")
elif (type(var1) == float):
    print("Type of the variable is Float")
elif (type(var1) == complex):
    print("Type of the variable is Complex")
elif (type(var1) == bool):
    print("Type of the variable is Bool")
elif (type(var1) == str):
    print("Type of the variable is String")
elif (type(var1) == tuple):
    print("Type of the variable is Tuple")
elif (type(var1) == dict):
    print("Type of the variable is Dictionaries")
elif (type(var1) == list):
    print("Type of the variable is List")
else:
    print("Type of the variable is Unknown")
```

Output:

> Type of the variable is Complex

### Nested if .. else statement

In general nested if-else statement is used when we want to check more than one conditions. Conditions are executed from top to bottom and check each condition whether it evaluates to true or not. If a true condition is found the statement(s) block associated with the condition executes otherwise it goes to next condition. Here is the syntax :

Syntax:

 
     if expression1 :
         if expression2 :
          statement_3
          statement_4
        ....
      else :
         statement_5
         statement_6
        ....
     else :
	   statement_7 
       statement_8

In the above syntax expression1 is checked first, if it evaluates to true then the program control goes to next if - else part otherwise it goes to the last else statement and executes statement_7, statement_8 etc.. Within the if - else if expression2 evaluates true then statement_3, statement_4 will execute otherwise statement_5, statement_6 will execute. See the following example.

age = 38
if (age >= 11):
  print ("You are eligible to see the Football match.")
  if (age <= 20 or age >= 60):
      print("Ticket price is $12")
  else:
      print("Tic kit price is $20")
else:
    print ("You're not eligible to buy a ticket.")

Output :

>You are eligible to see the Football match.
>Tic kit price is $20

In the above example age is set to 38, therefore the first expression (age >= 11) evaluates to True and the associated print statement prints the string "You are eligible to see the Football match". There after program control goes to next if statement and the condition ( 38 is outside <=20 or >=60) is matched and prints "Tic ket price is $12".


# Python Loops

Loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of program statements. In Python, and in most of programming languages, there are two main types of loops: for loop and while loops.

## For loop

In Python for loop is used to iterate over the items of any sequence including the Python list, string, tuple etc. The for loop is also used to access elements from a container (for example list, string, tuple) using built-in function range(). 

 The for loop is also used to access elements from a container (for example list, string, tuple) using built-in function range().

Syntax:
```
for variable_name in sequence :
    statement_1
    statement_2
    ....
```

**Parameter:**

Name | Description
----- | ------
variable_name | It indicates target variable which will set a new value for each iteration of the loop.
sequence | A sequence of values that will be assigned to the target variable variable_name. Values are provided using a list or a string or from the built-in function range().
statement_1,  
statement_2 ... | Block of program statements.

#### Example: Python for loop

```python
 #The list has four elements, indices start at 0 and end at 3
 color_list = ["Red", "Blue", "Green", "Black"]
 for c in color_list:
        print(c)

Red
Blue
Green
Black
```

In the above example color_list is a sequence contains a list of various color names. When the for loop executed the first item (i.e. Red) is assigned to the variable c. After this, the print statement will execute and the process will continue until we reach the end of the list.

### Python for loop and range() function

The range() function returns a list of consecutive integers. The function has one, two or three parameters where last two parameters are optional. It is widely used in for loops. Here is the syntax.

range(a) : Generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to a, excluding a, incrementing by 1.

```python
range(a)
range(a,b)
range(a,b,c)
```

Syntax:

for <variable> in range(<number>): 

Example:

```python
 for a in range(4):
  print(a)
```

>Output:
  0
  1
  2
  3

range(a,b): Generates a sequence of numbers from a to b excluding b, incrementing by 1.

Syntax:

for "variable" in range("start_number", "end_number"):

Example:

```python
 for a in range(2,7):
 print(a)
```

>Output:
  2
  3
  4
  5
  6

**range(a,b,c): Generates a sequence of numbers from a to b excluding b, incrementing by c.**

Example:
```python
 for a in range(2,19,5):
  print(a)
```
>Output:
 2
 7
 12 
 17


### Python for loop: Iterating over tuple, list, dictionary

Example: Iterating over tuple

The following example counts the number of even and odd numbers from a series of numbers.

```python
numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) # Declaring the tuple
count_odd = 0
count_even = 0
for x in numbers:
        if x % 2:
    	     count_odd+=1
        else:
    	     count_even+=1
print("Number of even numbers :",count_even)
print("Number of odd numbers :",count_odd)
```

>Output:
Number of even numbers:4
Number of odd numbers: 5

In the above example a tuple named numbers is declared which holds the integers 1 to 9.

The best way to check if a given number is even or odd is to use the modulus operator (%).
The operator returns the remainder when dividing two numbers.
Modulus of 8 % 2 returns 0 as 8 is divided by 2, therefore 8 is even and modulus of 5 % 2 returns 1 therefore 5 is odd.

The for loop iterates through the tuple and we test modulus of x % 2 is true or not, for every item in the tuple and the process will continue until we rich the end of the tuple.
When it is true count_even increase by one otherwise count_odd is increased by one.
Finally, we print the number of even and odd numbers through print statements.

Example: Iterating over list

In the following example for loop iterates through the list "datalist" and prints each item and its corresponding Python type.

```python
datalist = [1452, 11.23, 1+2j, True, 'w3resource', (0, -1), [5, 12],
{"class":'V', "section":'A'}]
for item in datalist:
   print ("Type of ",item, " is ", type(item))
```

>Output:
Type of  1452  is  <class 'int'>
Type of  11.23  is  <class 'float'>
Type of  (1+2j)  is  <class 'complex'>
Type of  True  is  <class 'bool'>
Type of  w3resource  is  <class 'str'>
Type of  (0, -1)  is  <class 'tuple'>
Type of  [5, 12]  is  <class 'list'>
Type of  {'section': 'A', 'class': 'V'}  is  <class 'dict'>

Example: Iterating over dictionary

In the following example for loop iterates through the dictionary "color" through its keys and prints each key.

```python
 color = {"c1": "Red", "c2": "Green", "c3": "Orange"}
 for key in color:
   print(key)
```
c2
c1
c3

Following for loop iterates through its values :

```python
 color = {"c1": "Red", "c2": "Green", "c3": "Orange"}
 for value in color.values():
   print(value)
```

Green
Red
Orange

You can attach an optional else clause with for statement, in this case, syntax will be -

```python
for variable_name in sequence :
    statement_1 
    statement_2
    ....
else :
    statement_3 
    statement_4
    ....
```

The else clause is only executed after completing the for loop. If a break statement executes in first program block and terminates the loop then the else clause does not execute. 

## While loop

While loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of program statements. Here is the syntax.

Syntax:

```python
while (expression) :
    statement_1
    statement_2
    ....
```

The while loop runs as long as the expression (condition) evaluates to True and execute the program block. The condition is checked every time at the beginning of the loop and the first time when the expression evaluates to False, the loop stops without executing any remaining statement(s). The following example prints the digits 0 to 4 as we set the condition x < 5.

```python
x = 0;
while (x < 5):
     print(x)
     x += 1
```

>Output:
0
1
2
3
4

One thing we should remember that a while loop tests its condition before the body of the loop (block of program statements) is executed. If the initial test returns false, the body is not executed at all. For example the following code never prints out anything since before executing the condition evaluates to false.

```python
x = 10;
while (x < 5):
     print(x)
     x += 1
```

### Python while loop

The following while loop is an infinite loop, using True as the check condition:

x = 10;
while (True):
     print(x)
     x += 1

**Python while loop is infinite _unless the !!check condition!! is changed to boolean False_**

### Python: while and else statement

There is a structural similarity between while and else statement. Both have a block of statement(s) which is only executed when the condition is true. The difference is that block belongs to if statement executes once whereas block belongs to while statement executes repeatedly.

You can attach an optional else clause with while statement, in this case, syntax will be -
```python
while (expression) :
    statement_1
    statement_2
    ......
else :
    statement_3
    statement_4
    ......
```

The while loop repeatedly tests the expression (condition) and, if it is true, executes the first block of program statements. The else clause is only executed when the condition is false it may be the first time it is tested and will not execute if the loop breaks, or if an exception is raised. If a break statement executes in first program block and terminates the loop then the else clause does not execute. In the following example, while loop calculates the sum of the integers from 0 to 9 and after completing the loop, else statement executes.

```python
x = 0;
s = 0
while (x < 10):
     s = s + x
     x = x + 1
else :
     print('The sum of first 9 integers : ',s)
```

>Output:
The sum of first 9 integers:  45

### Python while else loop

Example: while loop with if-else and break statement

```python
x = 1;
s = 0
while (x < 10):
     s = s + x
     x = x + 1
     if (x == 5):
          break
else :
     print('The sum of first 9 integers : ',s)
print('The sum of ',x,' numbers is :',s)
```

>Output:
The sum of  5  numbers is : 10

In the above example the loop is terminated when x becomes 5. Here we use break statement to terminate the while loop without completing it, therefore program control goes to outside the while - else structure and execute the next print statement. 

### break statement

The break statement is used to exit a for or a while loop. The purpose of this statement is to end the execution of the loop (for or while) immediately and the program control goes to the statement after the last statement of the loop. If there is an optional else statement in while or for loop it skips the optional clause also. Here is the syntax.

Syntax:

```python
while (expression1) :
     statement_1
     statement_2
     ......
    if expression2 :
     break

for variable_name in sequence :
   statement_1 
   statement_2
   if expression3 :
     break
```

Example: break in for loop

In the following example for loop breaks when the count value is 5. The print statement after the for loop displays the sum of first 5 elements of the tuple numbers.

```python
numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) # Declaring the tuple
num_sum = 0
count = 0
for x in numbers:
    num_sum = num_sum + x
    count = count + 1 
    if count == 5:
        break
print("Sum of first ",count,"integers is: ", num_sum)
```

>Output:
Sum of first  5 integers is:  15

Example: break in while loop

In the following example while loop breaks when the count value is 5. The print statement after the while loop displays the value of num_sum (i.e. 0+1+2+3+4).

```python
num_sum = 0
count = 0
while(count<10):
    num_sum = num_sum + count
    count = count + 1 
    if count== 5:
        break
print("Sum of first ",count,"integers is: ", num_sum)
```


Output:
Sum of first  5 integers is :  10

### continue statement

```python
The continue statement is used in a while or for loop to take the control to the top of the loop without executing the rest statements inside the loop. Here is a simple example.

for x in range(7):
    if (x == 3 or x==6):
        continue
    print(x)
```

>Output:
0
1
2
4
5

In the above example, the for loop prints all the numbers from 0 to 6 except 3 and 6 as the continue statement returns the control of the loop to the top

# Python Loops

## Python for Loop

### What is for loop in Python?

The for loop in Python is used to iterate over a sequence (list, tuple, string) or other iterable objects. Iterating over a sequence is called traversal.
Syntax of for Loop

```py
for val in sequence:
	Body of for
```

Here, val is the variable that takes the value of the item inside the sequence on each iteration.
Loop continues until we reach the last item in the sequence. The body of for loop is separated from the rest of the code using indentation.

#### Example: Python for Loop

```py
# Program to find the sum of all numbers stored in a list

# List of numbers
numbers = [6, 5, 3, 8, 4, 2, 5, 4, 11]

# variable to store the sum
sum = 0

# iterate over the list
for val in numbers:
	sum = sum+val

# Output: The sum is 48
print("The sum is", sum)
```

### The range() function

We can generate a sequence of numbers using range() function. range(10) will generate numbers from 0 to 9 (10 numbers).
We can also define the start, stop and step size as range(start,stop,step size). step size defaults to 1 if not provided.
This function does not store all the values in memory, it would be inefficient. So it remembers the start, stop, step size and generates the next number on the go.
To force this function to output all the items, we can use the function list().
The following example will clarify this.

```py
# Output: range(0, 10)
print(range(10))

# Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
print(list(range(10)))

# Output: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
print(list(range(2, 8)))

# Output: [2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17]
print(list(range(2, 20, 3)))
```

We can use the range() function in for loops to iterate through a sequence of numbers. It can be combined with the len() function to iterate though a sequence using indexing. Here is an example.

```py
# Program to iterate through a list using indexing

genre = ['pop', 'rock', 'jazz']

# iterate over the list using index
for i in range(len(genre)):
	print("I like", genre[i])
```

When you run the program, the output will be:

```txt
I like pop
I like rock
​I like jazz
```

## for loop with else

A for loop can have an optional **else** block as well. The else part is executed if the items in the sequence used in for loop exhausts.
**break** statement can be used to stop a for loop. In such case, the else part is ignored.
Hence, a for loop's else part runs if no break occurs.
Here is an example to illustrate this.

```py
digits = [0, 1, 5]

for i in digits:
    print(i)
else:
    print("No items left.")

```

When you run the program, the output will be:

```txt
0
1
5
No items left.
```

Here, the for loop prints items of the list until the loop exhausts. When the for loop exhausts, it executes the block of code in the else and prints

```txt
No items left.
```

---

## Python while Loop

### What is while loop in Python?

The while loop in Python is used to iterate over a block of code as long as the test expression (condition) is true.
We generally use this loop when we don't know beforehand, the number of times to iterate.

Syntax of while Loop in Python:

```py
while test_expression:
    Body of while
```

In while loop, test expression is checked first. The body of the loop is entered only if the test_expression evaluates to True. After one iteration, the test expression is checked again. This process continues until the test_expression evaluates to False.

In Python, the body of the while loop is determined through indentation.
Body starts with indentation and the first unindented line marks the end.
Python interprets any non-zero value as True. None and 0 are interpreted as False

```py
# Program to add natural
# numbers upto 
# sum = 1+2+3+...+n

# To take input from the user,
# n = int(input("Enter n: "))

n = 10

# initialize sum and counter
sum = 0
i = 1

while i <= n:
    sum = sum + i
    i = i+1    # update counter

# print the sum
print("The sum is", sum)
```

When you run the program, the output will be:

```txt
Enter n: 10
The sum is 55
```
In the above program, the test expression will be True as long as our counter variable i is less than or equal to n.

We need to increase the value of counter variable in the body of the loop. This is very important. Failing to do so will result in an infinite loop (loop that goes on forever).

Finally the result is displayed


### while loop with else

Same as that of for loop, we can have an optional else block with while loop as well.
The **else** part is executed if the condition in the while loop evaluates to False.
The while loop can be terminated with a break statement. In such case, the else part is ignored. Hence, a while loop's else part runs if no break occurs and the condition is false.
Here is an example to illustrate this.
```py
# Example to illustrate
# the use of else statement
# with the while loop

counter = 0

while counter < 3:
    print("Inside loop")
    counter = counter + 1
else:
    print("Inside else")
```

Output

```txt
Inside loop
Inside loop
Inside loop
Inside else
```

Here, we use a counter variable to print the string Inside loop three times.
On the forth iteration, the condition in while becomes False. Hence, the else part is executed

---
# Python break and continue

## What is the use of break and continue in Python?

In Python, break and continue statements can alter the flow of a normal loop.
Loops iterate over a block of code until test expression is false, but sometimes we wish to terminate the current iteration or even the whole loop without checking test expression.
The **break** and **continue** statements are used in these cases.

### Python break statement

The **break** statement terminates the loop containing it. Control of the program flows to the statement immediately after the body of the loop.
If break statement is inside a nested loop (loop inside another loop), break will terminate the innermost loop.
Syntax of break

```py
break
```
Example: Python break
```py
for val in "string":
    if val == "i":
        break
    print(val)

print("The end")
```

Output
```txt
s
t
r
The end
```

In this program, we iterate through the "string" sequence. We check if the letter is "i", upon which we break from the loop. Hence, we see in our output that all the letters up till "i" gets printed. After that, the loop terminates.

### Python continue statement

The **continue** statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. Loop does not terminate but continues on with the next iteration.
Syntax of Continue

```py
continue
```

Example: Python continue

```py
for val in "string":
    if val == "i":
        continue
    print(val)

print("The end")
```

Output
```txt
s
t
r
n
g
The end
```

This program is same as the above example except the break statement has been replaced with continue.
We continue with the loop, if the string is "i", not executing the rest of the block. Hence, we see in our output that all the letters except "i" gets printed.

---

# Python pass statement

## What is pass statement in Python?

In Python programming, pass is a null statement. The difference between a comment and pass statement in Python is that, while the interpreter ignores a comment entirely, pass is not ignored.

However, nothing happens when pass is executed. It results into no operation (NOP).
Syntax of pass

```py
pass
```

We generally use it as a placeholder.

Suppose we have a loop or a function that is not implemented yet, but we want to implement it in the future. They cannot have an empty body. The interpreter would complain. So, we use the pass statement to construct a body that does nothing.

```py
# pass is just a placeholder for
# functionality to be added later.
sequence = {'p', 'a', 's', 's'}
for val in sequence:
    pass
```



---

# Python Arrays

In programming, an array is a collection of elements of the same type.
Arrays are popular in most programming languages like Java, C/C++, JavaScript and so on. However, in Python, they are not that common. When people talk about Python arrays, more often than not, they are talking about Python lists. If you don't know what lists are, you should definitely check Python list article.

That being said, array of numeric values are supported in Python by the array module.

## Python Lists Vs array Module as Arrays

We can treat lists as arrays. However, we cannot constrain the type of elements stored in a list. For example:

```py
    a = [1, 3.5, "Hello"] 
```

If you create arrays using the array module, all elements of the array must be of the same numeric type.

```py
import array as arr
a = arr.array('d', [1, 3.5, "Hello"])   // Error
```

### How to create arrays?

As you might have guessed from the above example, we need to import array module to create arrays. For example:

```py
    import array as arr
    a = arr.array('d', [1.1, 3.5, 4.5])
    print(a)
```

Here, we created an array of float type. The letter 'd' is a type code. This determines the type of the array during creation.
Commonly used type codes:

Code | C Type | Python Type | Min bytes
---- | ------ | ---------- | --------
'b' | signed char | int | 1
'B' | unsigned char | int | 1
'u' | Py_UNICODE | Unicode | 2
'h' | signed short | int | 2
'H' | unsigned short | int | 2
'i' | signed int | int | 2
'I' | unsigned int | int | 2
'l' | signed long | int | 4
'L' | unsigned long | int | 4
'f' | float | float | 4
'd' | double | float | 8

We will not discuss about different C types in this article. We will use two type codes in this entire article: 'i' for integers and 'd' for floats.

**Note:** The 'u' type code for Unicode characters is deprecated since version 3.3. Avoid using it when possible.

### How to access array elements?

We use indices to access elements of an array:

```py
    import array as arr
    a = arr.array('i', [2, 4, 6, 8])
    print("First element:", a[0])
    print("Second element:", a[1])
    print("Last element:", a[-1])
```

Remember, the index starts from 0 (not 1) similar to lists.

### How to slice arrays?

We can access a range of items in an array by using the slicing operator :.

```py
    import array as arr
    numbers_list = [2, 5, 62, 5, 42, 52, 48, 5]
    numbers_array = arr.array('i', numbers_list)
    print(numbers_array[2:5]) # 3rd to 5th
    print(numbers_array[:-5]) # beginning to 4th
    print(numbers_array[5:])  # 6th to end
    print(numbers_array[:])   # beginning to end
```

When you run the program, the output will be:

```txt
array('i', [62, 5, 42])
array('i', [2, 5, 62])
array('i', [52, 48, 5])
array('i', [2, 5, 62, 5, 42, 52, 48, 5])
```

### How to change or add elements?

Arrays are mutable; their elements can be changed in a similar way like lists.

```py
    import array as arr
    numbers = arr.array('i', [1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10])
    # changing first element
    numbers[0] = 0    
    print(numbers)     # Output: array('i', [0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10])
    # changing 3rd to 5th element
    numbers[2:5] = arr.array('i', [4, 6, 8])   
    print(numbers)     # Output: array('i', [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10])
```

We can add one item to a list using the append() method, or add several items using extend() method.

```py
    import array as arr
    numbers = arr.array('i', [1, 2, 3])
    numbers.append(4)
    print(numbers)     # Output: array('i', [1, 2, 3, 4])
    # extend() appends iterable to the end of the array
    numbers.extend([5, 6, 7]) 
    print(numbers)     # Output: array('i', [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])
```

We can concatenate two arrays using + operator.

```py
    import array as arr
    odd = arr.array('i', [1, 3, 5])
    even = arr.array('i', [2, 4, 6])
    numbers = arr.array('i')   # creating empty array of integer
    numbers = odd + even
    print(numbers)    
```

### How to remove/delete elements?

We can delete one or more items from an array using Python's del statement.

```py
    import array as arr
    number = arr.array('i', [1, 2, 3, 3, 4])
    del number[2] # removing third element
    print(number) # Output: array('i', [1, 2, 3, 4])
    del number # deleting entire array
    print(number) # Error: array is not defined
```

We can use the remove() method to remove the given item, and pop() method to remove an item at the given index.

```py
    import array as arr
    numbers = arr.array('i', [10, 11, 12, 12, 13])
    numbers.remove(12)
    print(numbers)   # Output: array('i', [10, 11, 12, 13])
    print(numbers.pop(2))   # Output: 12
    print(numbers)   # Output: array('i', [10, 11, 13])
```

Check this page to learn more about Python array and array methods:

### When to use arrays?

Lists are much more flexible than arrays. They can store elements of different data types including string. Also, lists are faster than arrays. And, if you need to do mathematical computation on arrays and matrices, you are much better off using something like NumPy library.

Unless you don't really need arrays (array module may be needed to interface with C code), don't use them.



# Python Functions

In all programming and scripting language, a function is a block of program statements which can be used repetitively in a program. It saves the time of a developer. In Python concept of function is same as in other languages. There are some built-in functions which are part of Python. Besides that, we can defines functions according to our need.
User defined function

 > In Python, a user-defined function's declaration begins with the keyword def and followed by the function name. The function may take arguments(s) as input within the opening and closing parentheses, just after the function name followed by a colon.    After defining the function name and arguments(s) a block of program statement(s) start at the next line and these statement(s) must be indented.

Here is the syntax of a user defined function.

```python
Syntax:

 def function_name(argument1, argument2, ...) :
      statement_1
      statement_2
      ....
```

## Call a function

Calling a function in Python is similar to other programming languages, using the function name, parenthesis (opening and closing) and parameter(s). See the syntax, followed by an example.
Syntax:

```python
function_name(arg1, arg2)
```

Example:

```python
def avg_number(x, y):
    print("Average of ",x," and ",y, " is ",(x+y)/2)
avg_number(3, 4)
```

> Output:
>>Average of  3  and  4  is  3.5

### Explanation:

1. Lines 1-2 : Details (definition) of the function.
2. Line 3 : Call the function.
3. Line 1 : Pass parameters : x = 3, y = 4
4. Line 2 : Print the value of two parameters as well as their average value.

## Function without arguments:

The following function has no arguments.

```py
def function_name() :
    statement_1
    statement_2
    ....
```

Example:

```py
def printt():
    print("This is Python 3.2 Tutorial")
    print("This is Python 3.2 Tutorial")
    print("This is Python 3.2 Tutorial")
printt()
```

Output:

This is Python 3.2 Tutorial
               This is Python 3.2 Tutorial
               This is Python 3.2 Tutorial

Explanation:

1. Lines 1-4 : Details (definition) of the function.
2. Line 5 : Call the function.
3. Line 1 : No parameter passes.
4. Line 2-4 : Execute three print statements.

The Return statement in function

In Python the return statement (the word return followed by an expression.) is used to return a value from a function, return statement without an expression argument returns none. See the syntax.

```py
def function_name(argument1, argument2, ...) :
    statement_1
    statement_2
    ....
    return expression

function_name(arg1, arg2)
```

Example:

The following function returns the square of the sum of two numbers.

```py
def nsquare(x, y):
    return (x*x + 2*x*y + y*y)
print("The square of the sum of 2 and 3 is : ", nsquare(2, 3))
``` 



Output:

The square of the sum of 2 and 3 is :  25

Explanation:

1. Lines 1-2 : Details (definition) of the function.
2. Line 3 : Call the function within a print statement.
3. Line 1 : Pass the parameters x = 2, y = 3
4. Line 2 : Calculate and return the value of (x + y)2

## Default Argument Values

In function's parameters list we can specify a default value(s) for one or more arguments. A default value can be written in the format "argument1 = value", therefore we will have the option to declare or not declare a value for those arguments. See the following example.

Example:

The following function returns the square of the sum of two numbers, where default value of the second argument is 2.
```python
def nsquare(x, y = 2):
    return (x*x + 2*x*y + y*y)
print("The square of the sum of 2 and 2 is : ", nsquare(2))
print("The square of the sum of 2 and 3 is : ", nsquare(2,4))
```

Output:

The square of the sum of 2 and 2 is:  16
The square of the sum of 2 and 4 is :  36

#### Explanation:

1. Lines 1-2 : Details (definition) of the function.
For first print statement [ Line no 3]
2. Line 3 : Call the function without a second argument, within a print statement.
3. Line 1 : Pass the parameters x = 2, default value.
4. Line 2 : Calculate and return the value of (x + y)2
For second print statement [ Line no 4]
5. Line 3 : Call the function with all arguments, within a print statement.
6. Line 1 : Pass the parameters x = 2, y = 4.
7. Line 2 : Calculate and return the value of (x + y)^2

## Keyword Arguments:

We have already learned how to use default arguments values, functions can also be called using keyword arguments. Arguments which are preceded with a variable name followed by a '=' sign (e.g. var_name=") are called keyword arguments.

All the keyword arguments passed must match one of the arguments accepted by the function. You may change the order of appearance of the keyword. See the following example.

Example:

```python
def marks(english, math = 85, science = 80):
    print('Marks in : English is - ', english,', Math - ',math, ', Science - ',science)

marks(71, 77)
marks(65, science = 74)
marks(science = 70, math = 90, english = 75)
```

Output:

Marks in : English is -  71 , Math -  77 , Science -  80
Marks in : English is -  65 , Math -  85 , Science -  74
Marks in : English is -  75 , Math -  90 , Science -  70

#### Explanation:

Line 1: The function named marks has three parameters, there is no default value in the first parameter (english) but remaining parameters have default values (math = 85, science = 80).
Line 3: The parameter english gets the value of 71, math gets the value 77 and science gets the default value of 80.
Line 4: The parameter english gets the value of 65, math gets the default value of 85 and science gets the value of 74 due to keyword arguments.
Line 5: Here we use three keyword arguments and the parameter english gets the value 75, math gets the value 90 and science gets the value 70.

## Arbitrary Argument Lists:

The�arbitrary argument list�is an another way to pass arguments to a function. In the function body, these arguments will be wrapped in a tuple and it can be defined with *args construct. Before this variable, you can define a number of arguments or no argument.

Example:
```py
def sum(*numbers):
     s = 0
     for n in numbers:
           s += n
     return s

print(sum(1,2,3,4))
```

Output:

10

## Lambda Forms:

In Python, small anonymous (unnamed) functions can be created with lambda keyword. Lambda forms can be used as an argument to other function where function objects are required but syntactically they are restricted to a single expression. A function like this:

```py
def average(x, y):
    return (x + y)/2

print(average(4, 3))
```

**may also be defined using __lambda__**

```py
print((lambda x, y: (x + y)/2)(4, 3))
```

Output:

3.5

## Python Documentation Strings

In Python, a string literal is used for documenting  a module,  function, class, or method. You can access string literals by __doc__ (notice the double underscores) attribute of the object (e.g. my_function.__doc__).

Docstring Conventions :

  - String literal literals must be enclosed with a triple quote. Docstring should be informative

  - The first line may briefly describe the object's purpose. The line should begin with a capital letter and ends with a dot.

  - If a documentation string is a muti-line string then the second line should be blank followed by any detailed explanation starting from the third line.

 See the following example with multi-line docstring.

```py
def avg_number(x, y):
    """Calculate and Print Average of two Numbers.
    
    Created on 29/12/2012. python-docstring-example.py
    """
    print("Average of ",x," and ",y, " is ",(x+y)/2)

```

# Try and Except

In exception handling in Python, we use the try and except statements to catch and handle exceptions. The code within the try clause is executed statement by statement.

If an exception occurs, the rest of the try block is skipped and the except clause is executed.

```py
try:
'apple' + 6
except Exception:
print "Cannot concatenate 'str' and 'int' objects"
```
OUTPUT
```txt
Cannot concatenate 'str' and 'int' objects
```
We avoid the traceback error message elegantly with a simple message like above by using try except statements for exception handling.

In addition to using an except block after the try block, we can also use the finally block. The finally clause is optional. It is intended to define clean-up actions that must be executed under all circumstances

A finally clause is always executed before leaving the try statement, whether an exception has occurred or not.

Actions, like closing a file, GUI or disconnecting from the network, are performed in the finally clause to guarantee execution.

Here is an example of file operations to illustrate finally statement.

```py
try:
f = open("foo.txt",encoding = 'utf-8')
# perform file operations
finally:
f.close()
```
This type of statement makes sure that the file is closed whether an exception occurs or not.
